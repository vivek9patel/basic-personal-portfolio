# Sample Blog Post

This is a sample blog post demonstrating the new MDX setup with Next.js 15 and App Router.

## Features

- **Modern MDX**: Using the latest @next/mdx with App Router
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Powered by rehype-pretty-code and Shiki
- **React Components**: Full support for React components in MDX
- **Theming**: Respects your dark/light theme switching

## Code Examples

Here's a JavaScript code block with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  return `Welcome to the blog, ${name}`;
}

const message = greet("Developer");
```

And here's a TypeScript example:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

const createUser = (userData: Omit<User, 'id'>): User => {
  return {
    id: Math.random(),
    ...userData,
  };
};
```

## Lists and Formatting

- **Bold text** and *italic text*
- `Inline code` snippets
- [Links](https://nextjs.org) work perfectly
- ~~Strikethrough~~ text

### Ordered Lists

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote that demonstrates how content flows within the themed environment.
> 
> It supports multiple lines and maintains proper spacing.

## Tables

| Feature | Old Setup | New Setup |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| MDX Version | next-mdx-remote | @next/mdx |
| Router | Pages Router | App Router |
| Syntax Highlighting | rehype-highlight | rehype-pretty-code + Shiki |
| Performance | Good | Excellent |

## Images

You can use Next.js Image component directly in MDX:

```jsx
import Image from 'next/image'

<Image
  src="/sample-image.jpg"
  alt="Sample image"
  width={800}
  height={400}
  className="rounded-lg"
/>
```

## Conclusion

This new setup provides a much better developer experience with:
- Faster build times
- Better performance
- Modern tooling
- Seamless theming integration
